# Tic-Tac-Toe!

Helloooo this is Gugu and Marie welcome you to the game of tic-tac-toe. We always end up drawing the game between ourselves but we challenge you to find someone dumb enough whom you can win against!

Here's the guidelines to compile and run this game:
1. Run `make`
2. Run the server with `./server <PORT_NUMBER>`
3. Run two clients with `./client 127.0.0.1 <PORT_NUMBER>`
4. Follow the instructions on your screen and play!

Cheers
